This directory contains the necessary ingredients
to produce all input for the Fisher forecast
as performed in Thiele, Hill, Smith 2020.

1) Compile the driver code with
    sh compile.sh

2) Adapt main_forecast.sbatch to your specific system
    (it may be necessary to load differently named modules)

3) Run the array job with
    sbatch main_forecast.sbatch

4) Feed the results found in the results/ directory
   into your Fisher code.
   They are plain text files with the naming convention
     <prefix><param><p/m>_<Nbins>_<type>(_<noisy>)
   where
     <prefix> a book-keeping name defined in main_forecast.c
     <param>  the varied parameter,
                 As, Om, Mn (cosmology)
                 A,  B,  C  (concentration model)
     <p/m>    either p or m for plus and minus variations
              The specific parameter values can be found in the
              CLASS .ini files in cosmologies/
     [there is also one where instead of <param><p/m> you just
      have "fid", this is the fiducial run.]
     <Nbins>  an integer giving the number of bins the PDF was
              binned into
     <type>   either pdf or cov
     (_noisy) the versions including noise, as specified by the
              power spectrum Nell in main_forecast.c
